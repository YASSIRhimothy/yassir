    <h2>What are robots</h2>
    <p>
      Robots are machines that are designed to do tasks automatically. Some
      robots can follow instructions exactly, while others can think and make
      decisions using artificial intelligence. They can look like humans,
      animals, or just machines built for a specific job.

    <h2>Will robots take over people`s jobs</h2>
    <p>

      Robots and machines are changing how people work really fast, but that
      doesn’t mean they’ll take all the jobs. Instead, robots will help by doing
      dangerous and repetitive jobs that people don’t want to do like lifting
      heavy stuff in factories or organizing big piles of packages. This gives
      people more time to do the fun, creative, or caring jobs that robots
      aren’t good at!
    </p>
    <p>
      Robotics is the branch of technology that deals with the design,
      construction, and operation of robots.
