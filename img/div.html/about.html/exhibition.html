    <h2>What the PYP Exhibition is about</h2>
    <p>The PYP Exhibition is a culminating project for students in the Primary Years Programme (PYP) of the International Baccalaureate (IB). It is an opportunity for students to showcase their learning and understanding of a specific topic or issue. The exhibition is typically held at the end of the PYP program, and it allows students to demonstrate their skills in research, communication, and critical thinking.</p>
    <p>During the exhibition, students work collaboratively in groups to investigate a topic of their choice. They conduct research, create presentations, and engage with the community to share their findings. The exhibition is a celebration of student learning and provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their growth and development throughout the PYP program.</p>
