      Coding is the process of creating instructions for computers using
      programming languages.
    </p>
    <h2>What is coding</h1>
    <p>
      Coding is a way of giving instructions to a computer so it knows what to
      do. Just like we use language to talk to each other, we use special
      computer languages to "talk" to computers. These instructions can tell the
      computer to do all sorts of things—like showing a website, playing a
      video, or solving a math problem. Coding helps us create the apps, games,
      and programs we use every day. It’s kind of like writing a recipe: you
      give the computer a list of steps to follow, and if everything is written
      correctly, it will do exactly what you asked.
    </p>
    <h2>Why is coding important</h1>
    <p>
      Coding is important because it helps us tell computers what to do. We use
      coding to make video games, apps, websites, and even robots work! When you
      learn to code, you get better at solving problems and thinking in smart
      ways. It’s like learning a new language that lets you create cool things
      with technology. Coding is also fun because you can build your own games
      or projects and share them with others. In the future, knowing how to code
      can help you do lots of exciting jobs too!
    </p>
    <h2>How to start coding</h1>
    <p>
      To start coding, you can choose a simple programming language like Scratch
      or Python. Scratch is great for beginners because it uses blocks that you
      can snap together to create your own games and stories. Python is also
      easy to learn and is used by many people to make websites and apps. You
      can find lots of free online tutorials and games that teach you how to
      code step by step. Just remember, the most important thing is to have fun
      and not be afraid to make mistakes. Every coder started as a beginner,
      just like me!
